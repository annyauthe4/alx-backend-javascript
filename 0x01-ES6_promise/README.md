<h1> JAVASCRIPT PROMISE ES6.</h1>
<i>A Promise is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value</i>.


<b>A Promise has three states:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>pending</b> — initial state, operation not complete</li>

<li><b>fulfilled</b> — operation completed successfully</li>

<li><b>rejected</b> — operation failed</li>
</ul>
